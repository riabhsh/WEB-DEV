//++++++ Operators in Js ++++++
used to perform some operations on data

1. Arithmatic Operators
+,-,*,/,%,**

2. Unary Operators
-post increment/decrement
a++, a--
-pre increment/decrement
++a, --a

3. Assignment Operators
=, +=, -=, *=, %=, **=
example: a+=1 means a=a+1

4. Comparison(Relational) Operators
==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=

it Compares two Expressions and then gives true and false...

Equal to ==
Equalt to & type === //it is a stricter version of equal to
not euqal to !=
not equal to & type !== //it is a stricter version of not equal to


5. Logical Operators
Logical AND &&
Logical OR ||
Logical Not !

it Evaluates multiple Expressions and then gives true and false... works on boolean algebra.

6.Ternary Operators
works on 3 operands one is condition and two operands

condition?true output:false output;


//++++++ Conditional Statements in Js ++++++
if, if else, else if, switch(very very less used)

//++++++ alert/prompt in in Js ++++++
alert is popup in a browser with some message
alert("message!");

prompt is popup in a browser with some message and also takes some input
num = prompt("Enter a number!");


//**** 01 Introduction ****//

--Javascript is a programming language, 
we use it to give instructions to the computer.


--Variables: variables are containers for data.
give variables meaningful name.
by default variables are undefined if they dont have value.

eg:
let name = "rishabh maurya";
let age = 24;
let carrer = undefined;
let wealth = null;
let ambition = true;


-- Rules for variables --
1. variables are case sensitive; "a" & "A" is different.
2. only letters, digits, underscore(_) and $ is allowed. (not even space(use " " )).
3. only a letter, underscore(_) or $ should be in 1st character.
4. reserved words cant be a variable names.


-- Convention for writing variables --
-lowercase
-UPPPERCASE
-camelCase [recommended]
-snake_case 
-kabab-case
-PascalCase
-generally we prefer in Capital letter.


-- Variable Scope keywords(var, let & const) --
-var: a global scope variable, 
variable can be re-declared & updated.

-let: a block scope variable, 
variable can't be re-declared but can be updated.

-const: a block scope variable, 
variable can't be re-declared & updated.
*note: but key of the object can be updated.

*note: let and const introduced after ES6 and these two are used now days.. 

-- Data Types--
1. Primitive:
-number
-strings
-boolean
-undefined (by default all variables are undefined )
-null (absence of an object, its 'type of' is object but its primitive)
-BigInt (stores big integer values).
-symbol 

2. non-primitive(made up with priitive data types)
-objects(it's a collection or group of values | stores in key:value pairs).
generally we create objects with const.
--array
--function
