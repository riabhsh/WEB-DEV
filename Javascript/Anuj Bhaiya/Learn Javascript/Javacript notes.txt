[1] Introduction

= Javascript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically
updated content, control multimedia, animate images and much more

js code inserted between
<script>and<script> tags.

script loaded in last, style loaded first.

=how js works

js file -> parser -> AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) -> Conversion to Machine Code(011010...) -> Converted Machine Code -> Code Runs(runs in JS ENGINES like V8)

= Variables in Javascript
variables are containers for storing data(storing data values). we can declare
a variable by using these keywords.

1.var(old)
2.let(mutable can't be changed)
3.const(immutable can't be changed)

= Rules for writing variables
-variables name must start with either a letter, an underscore _, or the
dollar sign $
- variable names can't start with numbers.
Javascript is case-sensitive.
.keywords can't be used as variables names.

[2] Data Types
a Data type in programming, is a classification that specifies which type 
of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical
operations can be applied to it without causing an error.

- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Object

= Javascript Type Comversion
1.Javascript Considers 0 as false and all non-zero numbers as true.
and, if true is converted to a number, the result is always 1.

2.String() takes null and undefined and converts them into String.

3.in Javascript, undefined, null, 0, NaN," converts to false. all other
values gives true.

-Number()
-String()
-Boolean() [doule aur single quotes are converted to true "", '']
