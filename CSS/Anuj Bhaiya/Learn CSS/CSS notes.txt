-relative units: are good for User accesebilites. ,it is relative to something else like parent, viewport etc.

-note: dont confuse em with "emphasis element".

-margin: is seperates Elements from each other. (they are just space)s

-box sizing: content-box(default), border-box(use this for accurate sizing because it works with respect to border).

-in content-box all elements changes there size because of there content and there size changes differently even though we apply same width and height thats why we use border-box
